# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information about deployment, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `yarn eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments.

## Backend Configuration

The backend requires a few configuration settings to work correctly.

1. Go to the **config** folder in the backend directory and create a new file named `config.env`.

2. Add the following details to the `config.env` file:
